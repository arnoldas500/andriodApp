# andriodApp

Going to be using android studio to develop the mobile application which is an IDE (integrated developing environment)
Uses Gradle which is a build tool to set everything up
Another great feature is gradle scripts which can be set up which essentially runs a script through the app everything the app is run
Can add layouts, widgets images, etc. to the application very easily just by dragging and dropping.
Can switch and test different orientations and themes to see how it would look on an actual android device to get a very accurate look and feel for every page.
When running the app you can easily create virtual environments for different phones and different resolutions/ screen sizes for testing.
Dp or dip is density independent px for layout since phones come in many diff sizes and screen resolutions so this is a universal way to accomidate for that 
Sp is scale independent pixels to scale up based on user preferences on phone 
Use on click to send info from button in xml file to java (name function same as on click name)

User stories to keep:
Student:
I want to see the timer clearly so that I can pace myself accordingly. 
I want to see a clear description of the test, so that I am well prepared for it. 
I want to be able to easily reach all four possible answers with my thumb so the UI does not hinder my score.
I want to see the number of questions I attempted correctly or incorrectly to have a better understanding of my performance. --- combine with (I want to see my final score so that I know what my current skill level is.)
I want to see an insight to my final score that point out my
strengths and weaknesses, so I know what to improve. EX: need to improve subtraction skills if that's what the student got the most wrong.
Parent:
 I want to see my childrenâ€™s history of scores, so that I can see their progress. For example by date --- combine with ( I want to see when my children took the test, so that I know when they actually studied. )
I want to see what specific topic my children are struggling with the most, so that I have an understanding of what they need help with.
Teacher
I want to be able to set the length of the timer, so I can change the amount of time students get to take the exam.
I want to be able to increase the difficulty, so that I can continuously improve the arithmetic skills of my students.
I want to see the individual score of each student.
I want to be able to add and remove students, so that I can build my class of students within the app. 

Maybe section:
As a parent, I want to see the mistakes my children made, so that I can help correct them in the future.
As a parent, I want to be able to set achievements for my children, so that I can reward them accordingly. (What does this even mean lol)

Take out section:

As a parent, I want to see how my children are doing compare to the rest of their class, so I can have reasonable expectations of them. 
As a teacher, I want to see a graph of all of my students scores, so that I can analyze them on a macro level. 
As a teacher, I want to be able to set custom achievements, so I can motivate my students according to their skill level.
